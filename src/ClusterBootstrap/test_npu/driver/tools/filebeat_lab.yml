###################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only the most common
# options. The filebeat.reference.yml file from the same directory contains all the
# supported options with more comments. You can use it as a reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html

# For more available modules and options, please see the filebeat.reference.yml sample
# configuration file.

#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

filebeat.inputs:

# Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

- type: log

  # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
  enabled: true

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  paths:
  # -->hostDir pathset start
    - /var/log/npu/slog/*/*/*/*.log
    - /var/log/npu/slog/*/*/*.log
    - /var/log/npu/slog/*/*.log
    - /var/log/npu/slog/*.log
  # -->hostDir pathset end
  #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

  # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list.
  #exclude_lines: ['^DBG']

  # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
  # matching any regular expression from the list.
  include_lines: ['^\[ERROR] \S+(-?\d+,\S+):\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])-([01]\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d:[0-5]\d\.\d{3}\.\d{3} .+', '^\[OPLOG] \S+(-?\d+,\S+):\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])-([01]\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d:[0-5]\d\.\d{3}\.\d{3} .+', '^\[TRACE] \S+(-?\d+,\S+):\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])-([01]\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d:[0-5]\d\.\d{3}\.\d{3} .+']
  # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
  # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
  #exclude_files: ['.gz$']

  # How often the input checks for new files in the paths that are specified
  # for harvesting. Specify 1s to scan the directory as frequently as possible
  # without causing Filebeat to scan too frequently. Default: 10s.
  scan_frequency: 5s
  max_backoff: 1s
  close_inactive: 1m
  ignore_older: 30m

  # If close_archived enabled, all log files in archived_mode will be closed immediately
  # when harvester reaching the End Of File
  close_archived: true

  # If ignore_archived enabled, all files in archived_mode which is not been harvesting will be ignored
  # switch this on can save resource if no log in archived_mode exists before filebeat start
  ignore_archived: false

  # File mode for archived file, default 0440 if not declared
  archived_mode: 0440

  clean_removed: true
  harvester_buffer_size: 65536
  harvester_limit: 1000

  # Optional additional fields. These fields can be freely picked
  # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
  #fields:
  #  level: debug
  #  review: 1

  ### Multiline options

  # Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
  # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

  # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
  #multiline.pattern: '^\['

  # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
  #multiline.negate: true

  # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
  # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
  # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
  #multiline.match: after
#================================= Paths ======================================

# The home path for the filebeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the filebeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the filebeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which filebeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
path.data: /usr/slog

# The logs path for a filebeat installation. This is the default location for
# the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
# the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.logs: ${path.home}/logs

#========================= Filebeat global options ============================

# Name of the registry file. If a relative path is used, it is considered relative to the
# data path.
filebeat.registry.path: ${path.data}/filebeatregistry

# These config files must have the full filebeat config part inside, but only
# the prospector part is processed. All global options like spool_size are ignored.
# The config_dir MUST point to a different directory then where the main filebeat config file is in.
#filebeat.config_dir:

# How long filebeat waits on shutdown for the publisher to finish.
# Default is 0, not waiting.
#filebeat.shutdown_timeout: 0

# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
#name:

# The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
# transaction published.
#tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

# Optional fields that you can specify to add additional information to the
# output.
#fields:
#  env: staging

max_procs: 8

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
#setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601
  #host: "localhost:5601"


#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using filebeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and
# `setup.kibana.host` options.
# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.
#cloud.id:

# The cloud.auth setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.username` and
# `output.elasticsearch.password` settings. The format is `<user>:<pass>`.
